# Rich's Pizza Blockchain Traceability Platform

This is a comprehensive blockchain-based supply chain traceability solution for Rich's Frozen Pizza using Ganache CLI, Solidity smart contracts, Node.js backend, React frontend, and IoT simulation.

## Project Structure

- `/blockchain` - Ganache blockchain network configuration with Docker Compose
- `/contracts` - Solidity smart contracts with OpenZeppelin RBAC
- `/services/indexer-api` - Node.js Express API and blockchain event indexer
- `/ui` - React frontend with consumer-focused pizza traceability interface

## Consumer-Focused Architecture

- **Frontend**: Beautiful, simple consumer interface for pizza journey tracing
- **Backend**: Robust API with blockchain verification system
- **Simulation**: Complete supply chain entity simulation via Remix IDE
- **Documentation**: All guidance consolidated in single README.md

## Development Guidelines

- Use containerized development with Docker Compose
- Follow security-first principles with OpenZeppelin libraries
- Implement event-driven architecture with blockchain as source of truth
- Maintain role-based access control (RBAC) throughout the system
- Use environment variables for all configuration
