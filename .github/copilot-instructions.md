This is a comprehensive blockchain-based supply chain traceability solution for Rich's Frozen Pizza using Hyperledger Besu, Solidity smart contracts, Node.js backend, React frontend, and Python IoT simulation.

## Project Structure

- `/blockchain` - Hyperledger Besu network configuration with Docker Compose
- `/contracts` - Solidity smart contracts with OpenZeppelin RBAC
- `/services/indexer-api` - Node.js Express API and blockchain event indexer
- `/services/iot-simulator` - Python temperature sensor simulation
- `/ui` - React frontend with consumer and enterprise dashboards

## Development Guidelines

- Use containerized development with Docker Compose
- Follow security-first principles with OpenZeppelin libraries
- Implement event-driven architecture with blockchain as source of truth
- Maintain role-based access control (RBAC) throughout the system
- Use environment variables for all configuration

## Setup Checklist Progress

- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up blockchain network configuration
- [x] Implement smart contracts
- [ ] Create backend services
- [ ] Build frontend application
- [ ] Configure IoT simulator
- [ ] Integration testing
